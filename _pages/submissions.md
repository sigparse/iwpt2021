### Paper Submissions

IWPT 2021 welcomes electronic submissions (as PDF files) through the following submission page:  
<https://www.softconf.com/acl2021/w23_IWPT>

### Submission Format

All submissions must follow the ACL 2021 guidelines. Style templates for LaTeX and Microsoft Word are available at the following web site:
https://2021.aclweb.org/calls/papers/#submissions

Submissions must be anonymous, i.e. not reveal author(s) on the title page or through self-references. Paper submissions that violate this requirement will be rejected without review.

The page limits for submissions are: up to nine pages of content for regular papers, and up to four pages of content for short papers; any additional number of pages can be used for bibliographic references.

For more information, please see the [call for papers](/iwpt2021/cfp).
