IWPT 2021 continues the tradition of biennial meetings of [SIGPARSE](https://www.sigparse.org), the Special Interest Group on Natural Language Parsing of the [Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)](https://www.aclweb.org). It will be held at ACL 2021 as a one-day  co-located event.

IWPT addresses all aspects of computational structural analysis of natural language. For a non-exhaustive list of specific topics, please see the [call for papers](/cfp).

Continuing the series of parsing-oriented shared tasks established at IWPT 2020, the [IWPT 2021 Shared Task](https://universaldependencies.org/iwpt21/) will be on Multilingual Parsing into Enhanced Universal Dependendies.
