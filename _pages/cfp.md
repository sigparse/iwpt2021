### IWPT 2021: The 17th International Conference on Parsing Technologies
August 5 or 6, 2021, at ACL 2021

<https://iwpt21.sigparse.org/>

&nbsp;

## CALL FOR PAPERS

The ACL Special Interest Group on Natural Language Parsing (SIGPARSE) invites submissions to its biennial conference on parsing technologies. IWPT 2021 will be the 17th conference in a series that started in 1989. The conference will be held as a co-located ACL event on August 5 or 6, 2021.

### INVITED SPEAKER

Emily Pitler, Google AI


### TOPICS

IWPT addresses all aspects of structural analysis of natural language,
including but not limited to:

+ Parsing of natural language (phonological, morphological, syntactic, semantic, discourse, etc.)
+ Formal models and algorithms for recognition, parsing and transduction
+ Machine learning techniques for syntax and parsing
+ Complexity of languages, models and algorithms
+ Learning of recursive structure (linguistic/latent)
+ Parsing in machine translation (synchronous parsing; alignment by parsing; translation by parsing, etc.)
+ Cognitive models of language processing
+ Multilingual and multimodal perspectives on syntax and parsing
+ Domain and genre adaptation, portability and robustness of parsing systems
+ Practical applications of parsing technology
+ Parser evaluation (across languages and frameworks)
+ Neural network models for linguistic structure prediction
+ Combining distributional and symbolic signals for linguistic structure prediction
+ Syntactic typology for multilingual modeling
+ Parsing low-resource languages and cross-lingual or domain transfer
+ Interpretation of linguistic structure in deep learning models
+ Integration of morphology via character-based models, subword embeddings, and beyond


### IWPT 2021 SHARED TASK

Continuing the series of parsing-oriented shared tasks established at IWPT 2020, the 2021 IWPT Shared Task will be on Multilingual Parsing into Enhanced Universal Dependendies.

Additional details about the IWPT 2021 shared task will be posted here:
