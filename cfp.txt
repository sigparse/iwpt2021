The 17th International Conference on Parsing Technologies (IWPT 2021)
August 5 or 6, 2021, co-located with ACL-IJCNLP.

http://iwpt21.sigparse.org


CALL FOR PAPERS

The ACL Special Interest Group on Natural Language Parsing (SIGPARSE)
invites paper submissions to its biennial conference on parsing
technologies.  IWPT 2021 will be the 17th conference in a series that
started in 1989.  The conference will be held as a co-located event
with ACL-IJCNLP 2021, possibly in Bangkok, Thailand, or on-line.

The paper submission deadline for IWPT 2021 is April 26, 2021.

IWPT 2021 SHARED TASK

The IWPT 2021 Shared Task will be on Multilingual Parsing into Enhanced
Universal Dependencies (EUD).  In recent years, Universal Dependencies
(UD)—the de-facto standard target representations in surface-syntactic
dependency parsing—have grown a second layer of structure, called
enhanced dependencies, where grammatical relations that cannot be
adequately represented in pure rooted trees are encoded, for example
control relations and argument sharing in relative clauses, shared
dependencies involving coordinate structures, and dependencies
involving ellipsis.  Enhanced dependencies call for non-tree graphs
with reentrancies, cycles, and empty nodes. 

The IWPT 2021 Shared Task maintains its own schedule and submission
rules.  For full details, please seee

SUBMISSIONS

Submit your paper through the following submission page:

  https://www.softconf.com/acl2021/w23_IWPT/

IWPT addresses all aspects of structural analysis of natural language,
including but not limited to:

+ Parsing of natural language (phonological, morphological, syntactic,
  semantic, discourse, etc.)
+ Formal models and algorithms for recognition, parsing and
  transduction
+ Machine learning techniques for syntax and parsing
+ Complexity of languages, models and algorithms
+ Learning of recursive structure (linguistic/latent)
+ Parsing in machine translation (synchronous parsing; alignment by
  parsing; translation by parsing, etc.)
+ Cognitive models of language processing
+ Multilingual and multimodal perspectives on syntax and parsing
+ Domain and genre adaptation, portability and robustness of parsing
  systems
+ Practical applications of parsing technology
+ Parser evaluation (across languages and frameworks)
+ Neural Network Models for linguistic structure predictions
+ Combining distributional and symbolic signals for linguistic
  structure prediction
+ Multilingual and Universal Parsing, Parsing typologically different
  languages
+ Parsing low-resource languages and cross-lingual or domain transfer
+ Unblackboxing deep learning models to probe their level of linguistic
  analysis
+ Integrating morphology via character-based models, subword
  embeddings, and beyond

Paper submissions can be made in two distinct tracks:

+ regular papers on substantial, original, and unpublished research,
  including empirical evaluation results, where appropriate; and
+ short papers on smaller, focused contributions, work in progress,
  negative results, or opinion pieces.

Papers accepted for presentation at the conference will be included in
the IWPT 2021 proceedings, which will be published by the ACL and
included in the ACL Anthology.

SCHEDULE

+ April 26, 2021: Paper submission deadline
+ May 28, 2021: Notification of acceptance
+ June 7, 2021: Camera-Ready versions due
+ August 5 or 6, 2021: One-day conference

SUBMISSION FORMAT

All submissions must follow the ACL 2021 guidelines.  Style templates
for LaTeX and Microsoft Word are available at the following web site. 

  https://2021.aclweb.org/downloads/acl-ijcnlp2021-templates.zip

Submissions must be anonymous, i.e. not reveal author(s) on the title
page or through self-references.  Papers must be submitted digitally,
in PDF, and uploaded through the online conference system: 

  https://www.softconf.com/acl2021/w23_IWPT/

Paper submissions that violate either of these requirements will be
returned without review.

The page limits for submissions are: up to nine pages of content for
regular papers, and up to four pages of content for short papers; any
additional number of pages can be used for bibliographic references.
